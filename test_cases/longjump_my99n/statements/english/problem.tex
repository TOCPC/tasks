\begin{problem}{jumping}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{64 megabytes}

given a n by m grid and w walls. The edge of the grid (row 0, n+1 and col 0, m+1) are also walls. If (a+-1, b) is wall, then it's possible to move from (a, b) to (x, b) such that there's no wall in between (a, b) and (x, b). Similar moving rule applies for column, that is it's possible to move from (a, b) to (a, x) such that there's no wall in between (a, b) and (a, x) if there's a wall on (a, b+-1). Note that wall (a+-1, b) also counts if it's in the jumping path.

Find minimum moves from (sx, sy) to (ex, ey).

the grid coordinate for sx, sy, ex, ey, and walls are from 1-n and 1-m.
