If (a+-1, b) is wall, then it's possible to move from (a, b) to (x, b) such that there's no wall in between (a, b) and (x, b). Similar moving rule applies for column, that is it's possible to move from (a, b) to (a, x) such that there's no wall in between (a, b) and (a, x) if there's a wall on (a, b+-1). Note that wall (a+-1, b) also counts if it's in the jumping path.\n\nFind minimum moves from (sx, sy) to (ex, ey).\n\nthe grid coordinate for sx, sy, ex, ey, and walls are from 1-n and 1-m.","authorLogin":"my99n","language":"english","timeLimit":1000,"output":"A #a minimum number of jump required","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"n, m, w\nsx, sy\nex, ey\n[w lines follow]\nx, y","authorName":"Touch Sungkawichai","sampleTests":[{"output":"1\n","input":"5 5 0\n4 1\n4 3\n","inputFile":"example.01","outputFile":"example.01.a"},{"output":"3\n","input":"5 5 3\n2 2\n1 4\n1 2\n4 1\n5 4\n","inputFile":"example.02","outputFile":"example.02.a"}],"name":"jumping","interaction":null,"memoryLimit":67108864,"tutorial":""}
