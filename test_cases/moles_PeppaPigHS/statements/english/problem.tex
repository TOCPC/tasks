\begin{problem}{moles}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

mole holes are everywhere. Mole can pop out at any point on the number line for 1 second then go back in. Alice, with a hammer, stands initially at a. How many moles can Alice hammer if moving 1 unit on the number require exactly 1 second.

there will be n moles popping out, the ith mole will pop out at number si on the number line after exactly ti second had passed.

\InputFile
n a
[n lines follow]
si ti

\OutputFile
one integer, maximum number of moles alice can hammer
